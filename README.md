# IP_Finder_and_Validator
Given a log file, grab as many IP addresses (4 octet numbers) as you can and push those numbers through an IP address validator to verify their correctness. Print out if they are valid or not. Keep track of how many times you see each IP address. Pay close attention to the example output for the formatting and ordering details.
